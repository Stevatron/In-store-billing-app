  <h1>In-Store Billing Application</h1>

  <p>The application is a versatile management and sales tool designed to streamline operations in a store or retail environment. It provides two main sections: Administration/Statistics and Sales/Checkout. In the Administration/Statistics section, users can manage categories by adding, deleting, and modifying them. They can also view valuable sales statistics, including the total quantity of products sold on the current day compared to the overall quantity of products sold since the store's establishment.

In the Sales/Checkout section, users can browse products by category, add them to the cart, and proceed with the checkout process. After completing a transaction, users have the option to save the receipt, which is stored in JSON format for future reference. This allows users to track and analyze sales data.

The application aims to enhance efficiency and organization in store management, providing a user-friendly interface for handling categories, products, and sales-related tasks. It helps store owners and employees keep track of sales performance, manage inventory, and streamline the checkout process for improved customer experience.

Overall, the application offers a comprehensive solution for managing store operations and analyzing sales data, ultimately contributing to better decision-making and improved productivity in a retail setting.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Limitations</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The current version of the application does not support entering decimal values for the quantity of products sold in pieces. Potential enhancements could include adding support for decimal values.</li>
    <li>The application currently lacks comprehensive input validation. It would be beneficial to include additional checks to ensure that users provide all the necessary information and prevent them from       accidentally leaving any fields blank or incomplete.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The application requires the user to have Newtonsoft JSON library installed in order to run successfully. Make sure to have the Newtonsoft JSON library set up before running the program.</li>
  <li>The application is built using C#, so it requires a compatible C# development environment, such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, to compile and run the code.</li>
